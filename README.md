🌲 IoT-Based Forest Fire Detection and Alert System
🔍 Overview

This project is an IoT-based forest fire detection system designed using the Arduino Uno R4 WiFi board. It continuously monitors temperature, humidity, and smoke levels using DHT11 and MQ2 sensors.
The readings are displayed locally on a 16×2 I2C LCD and uploaded to the Blynk IoT platform for real-time monitoring through a mobile app.
When the system detects a high temperature or smoke level, it triggers a buzzer alarm and sends an instant notification to the user via Blynk.
